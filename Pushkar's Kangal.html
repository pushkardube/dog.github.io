The Kangal is a breed of large livestock guardian dog originating from the Sivas province of Turkey. The breed is of an early Mastiff type with a solid, pale tan or sabled coat, and a black mask. According to official Kangal organisations in Turkey, including the Cynology Federation of Turkey and the Ankara Kangal Association, Kangals may also be brindle or feature a recessive black tan pattern; with or without a black mask; and/or with white markings.
