The Shetland Sheepdog, also known as the Sheltie, is a breed of herding dog. The original name of this breed was Shetland Collie, but this caused controversy among the Rough Collie breeders at the time, so the breed's name was formally changed to Shetland Sheepdog. This small dog is intelligent, vocal, excitable, energetic and willing to please and work hard. The breed was formally recognized by The Kennel Club in 1909.
